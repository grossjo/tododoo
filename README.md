To do, To do, To do doo. 


The Take Home:
In order to prepare for your upcoming interview, we ask that you spend some time developing a small application based on the following feature request:

As a business owner I often find that I have a wide variety of things to complete. Rather than buying software, I'd prefer to have a simple application where I can create a list of items I need to complete. I would like the ability to create new items, delete existing items, and list all of my current items todo.

In essence this is a TODO List application. We ask that you build a simple implementation based on the statement above. Some assumptions you can build with are:
The application does not require data to persist. Building up items in memory is fine
The application should be interactive. Using a UI, API, or the CLI is perfectly acceptable.
We will be using this prepared application as a starting point, and extending it during the interview

# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

# Setup

If you have a wonky dev environment and you didn't do this in a container, spring may be running.

Run `spring stop` see:
